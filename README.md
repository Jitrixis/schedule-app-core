About the MozFest Schedule App
==============================

This is the [schedule app](https://app.mozillafestival.org/) for the 2015 Mozilla Festival, which took place at Ravensbourne in London, Nov. 6-8. It provides a mobile- and desktop-friendly way to browse and search the event's sessions, spaces, and pathways.

The app was [originally developed for SRCCON](https://github.com/OpenNews/srccon-schedule), the annual conference from Knight-Mozilla OpenNews. UI, design, and feature updates were provided by Mozilla staff and volunteers to scale the app for MozFest, which has hundreds of sessions and different ways of grouping them.

Design notes:

* built for ease of mobile use, assuming that people will primarily use the schedule on location at the event
* provides a full-text, searchable session list in addition to daily schedule tabs
* groups sessions and other events into schedule "blocks" according to start times
* opens full session descriptions on tap or click, using a separate template that allows for display of extended data
* supports session favoriting (using browser localstorage) to help attendees build a custom schedule
* can toggle display for entire "blocks" of the schedule
* automatically opens schedule tab for current date if possible
* flags sessions and events marked for "everyone" on daily and favorites tabs

Technical notes:

* stores data in a single JSON file, generated by [a Python script](https://github.com/mozilla/mozfest-schedule-loader) that pulls data from a Google Docs spreadsheet
* can use cache manifest for offline mode, although this is not recommended because cache manifest is terrible
* can easily publish to production via GitHub Pages (triggering the Python script to update schedule data also creates an automated commit, which rebuilds the schedule site thanks to GitHubPages/Jekyll)
* uses jQuery and Underscore for DOM and data manipulation
* uses [marked](https://github.com/chjj/marked) for pretty text formatting
