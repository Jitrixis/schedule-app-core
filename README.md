MozFest Schedule App
====================

This is a tweaked version of [the code that runs OpenNews' SRCCON schedule](https://github.com/OpenNews/srccon-schedule), currently in testing and filled with randomized session data from last year's MozFest (so start times might look a little weird here and there). Design and UI updates are in the works to help this scale to MozFest.

Design notes:

* built primarily for mobile use, assuming that people will need this on location at the event
* tapping on a session opens its full description (using a template that allows for additional data if necessary)
* provides a full-text, searchable session list in addition to day-by-day schedule tabs
* session favoriting (using browser localstorage) populates a per-device custom schedule tab
* highlights schedule tab for current date if possible
* colors denote normal-length and long sessions, and long sessions are "ghosted" into the following schedule block to show that they're still going on

Technical notes:

* stores data in a single json file, generated by a Python script that pulls data from a Google Docs spreadsheet
* designed to publish via GitHub Pages (triggering the Python script to update schedule data also creates an automated commit, which rebuilds the schedule site)
* uses jQuery and Underscore for DOM and data manipulation
* uses [marked](https://github.com/chjj/marked) for pretty text formatting

This app was originally built on the fly in the week before SRCCON 2014, so some components are fairly bespoke. A couple things I've been intending to address:

* tab dates are defined in `schedule.js` itself, rather than calculated by looking for unique values from the list of sessions
* color categories are tied to SRCCON's 1- and 2.5-hour session formats
